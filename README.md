## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
### Welcome!
 
#### I'm Giovanna, a developer from Brazil.
 
I'm a south american girl with a bachelor degree in architecture, who changed carreer paths to become a developer. 
The projects here were mainly made in Java, Spring Boot, Typescript and React but you'll also find projects in Kotlin, Python and Javascript.

I love learning and coding. Let's see where my curiosity takes me. ðŸ˜Œ

Feel free to contact me if you need.
