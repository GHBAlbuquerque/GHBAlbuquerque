## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
### Welcome!
 
#### I'm Giovanna, a Junior Front-End Developer from Brazil.
 
Productive, communicative, sociable and creative professional, I have a bachelor degree in Architecture and have just recently started exploring my passion for coding. 

I yearned to learn more about it, and from this yearning I started studying Front-End development. Since then, I canâ€™t get enough. Learning about web development and responsive design has been an intense and passionate ride, as learning comes fast, but the topics are infinite. The moldable, creative work that coding a webpage requires is challenging and satisfying.

Learning is a never ending process, and I feel like Iâ€™ve just taken the first steps of what looks like a very long journey, to which Iâ€™m beyond excited.
