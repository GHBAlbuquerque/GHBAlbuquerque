## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
### Welcome!
 
#### I'm Giovanna, a Junior Full-Stack Developer from Brazil.
 
Productive, communicative, sociable and creative professional, I have a bachelor degree in Architecture and have just recently started exploring my passion for coding. 

I yearned to learn more about it, and from this yearning I started studying to become a developer. Since then, I canâ€™t get enough. Learning about web development has been an intense and passionate ride, as learning comes fast, but it requires a lot of practice and dedication.

Learning is a never ending process, and I feel like Iâ€™ve just taken the first steps of what looks like a very long journey, to which Iâ€™m beyond excited.
